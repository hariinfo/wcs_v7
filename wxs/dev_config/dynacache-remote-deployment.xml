<!--
Configuration notes:
1. developmentMode=true : Our sample environment is running all containers on the same node. 
Normally, replicas will only be created on different nodes from the primary. We must set this for development mode to indicate
that we would like replicas created even though the container servers are on the same node.
2. numInitialContainers=2 : We need to start container server twice
